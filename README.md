A Guide to elicit ethical requirements for AI.

In the guide 24 cards are provided, distributed along the 11 principles adopted for the elaboration of the guide, plus 2 additional cards: Stakeholders' assessment, and Overall ethical evaluation, both under the topic of Assessment. Thus, in total there are 26 cards. In the sprint backlog meeting, the actors must choose the cards that will be used in that sprint, read aloud the content of the card, then the development team will elicit the ethical requirements in the form of user stories, also writing down the reasoning that led them to those user stories. Validation should be done by development teams together with customers and multiple stakeholders, who may request changes.
