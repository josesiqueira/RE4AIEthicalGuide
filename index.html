        <p>This guide assists the elicitation of Ethical Requirements in AI-based systems by software development teams, with a focus on agile teams, where Product Owners and developers use a set of cards to answer questions related to ethical principles in AI at each sprint, creating requirements in the form of user stories and including them in Sprint backlogs.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>This deck of cards works like a Planning Poker. There are X cards separated across Y Principles. The cards contain Motivation, What to do, Practical example and tool suggestions.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>The user must start with card 0, then select any card, and can: use the Compare option, selecting specific cards to display them in order to compare them with others - from different principles or not; use the Filter option, displaying all cards from a specific principle.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>The development team should document the discussion made through the cards, as well as the consensus reached, so that possible changes can be re-evaluated later. In this way, the principles of Transparency and Trust are enabled.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>During the requirements elicitation phase there is a greater interaction between different actors involved in the software development and its use, providing a fertile environment for debate on ethical issues \cite{Kostova2020}, and there is a reduction of additional work by considering ethical issues in the early stages of software development, and not as an afterthought \cite{vakkuri2020eccola}.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>There is no minimum number of cards required in each Sprint, nor is there an order to be followed.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>Feel free to choose any card and start eliciting ethical requirements for AI-based systems.</p>
