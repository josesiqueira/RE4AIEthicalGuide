      <h2 class="about__title">Principles</h2>
      <p>
        The evolution of the emergence of software that makes use of AI
        techniques, mostly ML, amplifies the manifestations of accidents and the
        awareness of the associated ethical issues [1]. In general, ethics in AI
        has been addressed, in the literature, in its theoretical field, through
        ethical guidelines [2]. In the last three years, there has been a
        veritable proliferation of organisations publishing guidelines seeking
        to provide normative guides to AI ethics [3,4]. As of November 2019, at
        least 84 of these initiatives have published reports describing ethical
        principles, values or other high-level abstract requirements for the
        development and deployment of AI [2]. Due to this high number of
        publications, sometimes the terms appear interchangeably in the papers,
        as in the <a href="https://futureoflife.org/ai-principles/"
          >Asilomar AI Principles</a
        >, where they present principles composed of guidelines. We assume
        throughout this paper that the guidelines -- the guides -- contain the
        principles of AI ethics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whilst the existence of guidelines and principles is necessary, little
        practical direction exists for developers -- those responsible for
        implementing ethics in AI-based systems -- to apply in real-world
        contexts, even more so with the demands for market deliverables [2],
        where often the ethical considerations involved is a quality to be
        considered in software only after its deployment [5]. Furthermore,
        developers do not receive adequate training within development projects,
        nor during their education. There are no legal consequences for not
        implementing AI ethics, as the guidelines present in the literature, and
        proposed by organisations, are often non-binding laws, and the AI
        developer not being a formal profession. To clarify: "Reports and
        guidance documents for AI ethics are examples of what is called policy
        instruments of a non-binding character or soft law&apos;&apos;[6]. Thus,
        there is neither motivation nor punishment for developers in the area of
        AI ethics. In this sense, binding laws are paramount to effectively
        align public interests with practice in application development in the
        context of AI.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Legally binding documents</strong>, backed by legislation,
        provide the actors involved in the process with real binding
        responsibilities and rights. These types of documents are called binding
        or hard law. We will present the two most notorious binding laws. First,
        the European Union&apos;s (EU) 
        <a href="https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-5419-2016-INIT/en/pdf"
          >General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a> -- which
        came into force on 25 May 2018 and has been hugely influential in
        establishing safeguards for personal data protection in today&apos;s
        technological environment. Several countries outside the EU have adopted
        similar data protection rules, analogous to or inspired by GDPR, which
        is increasingly being recognised for its high standard of data
        protection, Brazil being one such nation. Aimed at empowering EU
        citizens to have control over their data and protect them from data and
        privacy breaches, the GDPR applies to all relevant actors within the EU
        and those who process, monitor or store EU citizens&apos; data outside
        the EU [7]. Second, the
        <a
          href="http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2015-2018/2018/lei/l13709.htm"
          >General Law on Personal Data Protection (LGPD)</a
        >
        in Brazil, which came into force on 18 September 2020, with the sanction
        of Law 14.058/2020, originating from Provisional Measure (MP) 959/20.
        The LGPD defines "rights of individuals in relation to their personal
        information and rules for those who collect and handle these records
        with the aim of protecting the fundamental rights of freedom and privacy
        and the free development of the personality of citizens.&quot;. An
        effort towards harmonisation between AI ethics guidelines (non-binding)
        and legislation (legally binding) is an important next step for the
        global community [6]
      </p>
      <p>
        AI ethics guidelines contain ethical principles, and each published
        guideline contains its own set of principles. In the literature, most
        studies focus on the conceptual part of AI ethics, and one of them is
        the compilation, presentation and evaluation of ethics guidelines and
        their principles. Several authors have used different methodologies to
        explore sets of documents and extract the most recurrent principles and
        their definitions, usually concluding that they are too general, have
        high level of abstraction and degree of difficulty in applying them in
        real contexts, besides there is an overlap between the principles.
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p>
        Ryan and Stahl [8] conducted a rigorous study with a robust methodology
        that reviewed a set of guidelines and compiled the detailed guidance
        that is available, presenting a list of principles aimed at developers
        and users. To the best of our knowledge, this is the study that makes
        use of a methodology that encompasses the most guidelines and
        definitions -- as well as presenting a comprehensive taxonomy.

      <p><br /></p>
      <h2 class="about__title">1. Transparency</h2>
      <p>
        Transparency has quickly become one of the most widely discussed
        principles within the AI ethics debate, with Floridi (2019) and the
        High-Level Expert Group on AI (2019) viewing it as a defining
        characteristic within the debate. Transparency can typically be
        understood in two ways: the transparency of the AI technology itself and
        the transparency of the AI organisations developing and using it.
        Throughout our analysis, transparency was regularly discussed directly,
        or in relation to processes required to ensure it, such as
        explainability, understandability and communication.
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>1.2 Transparency. </strong></p>
      <p>
        AI developers need to ensure transparency because it protects many other
        requirements &ndash; such as the fundamental human rights, privacy,
        dignity, autonomy and well-being (UNI Global Union, 2017). Organisations
        using AI should be transparent about their aim for using AI, benefits
        and harms and potential outcomes that may occur (IBM, 2017). AI
        developers should ensure transparency because it allows consumers to
        make informed choices about sharing their data and using AI (ADMA,
        2013).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>1.3 Explainability. </strong></p>
      <p>
        AI must be subject to active monitoring to ensure that they are
        producing accurate results (Algo.Rules, 2019). AI organisations should
        document how their AI makes certain decisions and be able to reproduce
        them for audits (SIIA, 2017). AI should be explainable to external
        algorithmic auditing bodies to ensure the technical and ethical
        functionality of their AI. If there is a tension between performance and
        explainability, this should be clearly identified (Cerna Collectif,
        2018).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>1.4 Explicability. </strong></p>
      <p>
        AI organisations (i.e. organisations using or developing AI) should be
        able to intelligibly explain the data that goes in, the data coming out,
        what their algorithms do, and their objective for doing so (Demiaux and
        Abdallah, 2017, p. 51). AI organisations should ensure traceability and
        explicability to guarantee safety (OECD 2019). AI needs to have a strong
        degree of traceability to ensure that if harms arise, they can be traced
        back to the cause (IEEE, 2017). Data should be traceable back to where,
        how and when it was captured, retrieved, cleaned and analysed (Cerna
        Collectif, 2018). Decisions made by AI should be reproducible by
        external auditors (AMA, 2018).
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>1.5 Understandability. </strong></p>
      <p>
        AI organisations need to implement appropriate methods to monitor the
        data, algorithms and the decisions that will be arrived at by those
        processes, and for actions taken by AI to be comprehensible by human
        beings (European Parliament, 2017). AI organisations should understand
        how their AI works and explain the technical functioning and decisions
        reached by those technologies, whenever possible (Floridi et al., 2018).
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>1.6 Interpretability. </strong></p>
      <p>
        While there is a degree of opaqueness in some machine-learning
        technologies, AI organisations should be able to understand how a
        decision was reached and how human oversight ensures that harms caused
        by algorithmic black-boxing are addressed and prevented (IEEE, 2019).
        High-stake domains (such as health care, criminal justice and welfare)
        should reconsider using black-box AI altogether (AI Now Institute,
        2017). Algorithmic reviews should be done on a regular basis to
        determine if they are fit-for-purpose and interpretable (Algo.Rules,
        2019). Organisations should be able to clearly interpret and demonstrate
        how their AI is abiding by current legislation, such as the general data
        protection regulation (GDPR), and be able to demonstrate what measures
        are being taken to ensure compliance (UK Government, 2018).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>1.7 Communication. </strong></p>
      <p>
        End users should be provided with accurate information to ensure that
        they are not manipulated, deceived, or coerced by AI (High-Level Expert
        Group on AI, 2019, p. 16). End users should be informed about the intent
        and outcomes of the technology (IBM, 2018). AI companies should be
        explicitly clear and discuss in a jargon-free manner, the potential
        flaws or harm that may arise from their AI (Algo.Rules, 2019).
        Communication methods may have to change for different industries,
        expertise and context of use (Floridi et al.,2018). AI organisations
        should communicate their progress and likelihood to hit particular
        milestones to governments, so that they can plan for these outcomes
        (NSTC, 2016a).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>1.8 Disclosure. </strong></p>
      <p>
        AI should be designed and used to retrieve little to no personal data,
        or if required, that any data retrieved is anonymised, encrypted and
        securely processed, while being able to demonstrate this to a
        third-party auditor (High-Level Expert Group on AI, 2019). AI should go
        through internal and external auditing to ensure they are fit for
        purpose, but the organisation also needs to be able to explain and
        justify the use of their AI. Organisations should allow for independent
        analysis and review of their systems (Amnesty International/Access Now,
        2018).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>1.9 Showing. </strong></p>
      <p>
        Data should be accurate, up-to-date and fit-for-purpose, and companies
        should be able to demonstrate this (ICO, 2017). Data quality should be
        transparent, available for periodic assessment and there should be
        regular and continued anomaly detection set in place [United Nations
        Development Group (UNDG), 2017]. Developers of AI should also be able to
        provide their ethics codes to public authorities, organisational users
        and where possible, the public (University of Montreal, 2017). This can
        be achieved through periodic review sessions, appropriate oversight
        mechanisms and collective responsibility approaches within the
        organisation (ICDPPC, 2018). It should also be clear to the end user
        that they are interacting with an AI system, rather than a human (EPSRC,
        2011).
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <h2 class="about__title">2. Justice and fairness</h2>
      <p>
        Discrimination and unfair outcomes stemming from algorithms has become a
        hot topic within the media and academic circles (O&rsquo;Neil, 2016). It
        is not surprising that issues of fairness, equality and equity were
        repeatedly discussed throughout the ethics guidelines. In addition to
        simply addressing issues of harm and injustice themselves, many of the
        guidelines provided recommendations on how to implement steps to
        minimise these harms. Furthermore, some documents also highlighted how
        different organisations should implement methods to reverse, remedy and
        allow fair redress, in instances where harms have occurred.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>2.1 Justice.</strong></p>
      <p>
        AI practitioners should identify what levels of justice and fairness can
        be implemented into the AI system during the design process (NSTC,
        2016b). For example, if AI is used within the judicial system in any
        way, accountability should still lie with the human user, e.g. the judge
        (Rathenau Institute, 2017, p. 43). In addition, AI will replace many
        human jobs in the future, so it is important that there are effective
        and just ways to retrain and retool the human workforce (COMEST/UNESCO,
        2017, pp. 52-53).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>2.2 Fairness.</strong></p>
      <p>
        While AI developers may have their own values, they should not develop
        algorithms with historically unfair prejudices (Latonero, 2018). There
        should be steps in place to ensure that data being used by AI is not
        unfair, or contains errors and inaccuracies, that will corrupt the
        response and decisions taken by the AI (ICO, 2017). To ensure the
        fairness of AI, their design should be fit for purpose, identify impacts
        on different aspects of society and should be designed to promote human
        welfare, rather than endanger it (ICDPPC, 2018). Organisations should
        consider using fairness-aware data mining algorithms (FATML,
        2016).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>2.3 Consistency. </strong></p>
      <p>
        To prevent harmful actions in the decision-making process, organisations
        should ensure that accurate and representative sample data is collected,
        analysed and used [IPC Ontario (Information and Privacy Commissioner of
        Ontario), 2017]. Organisations need to establish procedures to ensure
        the identification, prevention and the minimisation of inaccuracies in
        their AI. To achieve this, data should be of the highest quality (UNDG,
        2017), external algorithmic auditing should be carried out (Intel ,
        2017), and there should be consistent, repeated and regular discussions
        with end users and stakeholders that may be affected (PwC, 2019).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>2.4 Inclusion. </strong></p>
      <p>
        AI should not become another tool for exclusion within society (AI for
        Humanity, 2018). Particular attention should be given to
        under-represented and vulnerable groups and communities, such as those
        with disabilities, ethnic minorities, children and those in the
        developing world (High-Level Expert Group on AI, 2019). Data that is
        being used should be representative of the target population and should
        be as inclusive as possible (High-Level Expert Group on AI, 2019). AI
        organisations should not only reduce exclusion issues but should promote
        active inclusion of women and minority groups into the development and
        design of AI (Gilburt, 2019; WEF, 2018).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>2.5 Equality. </strong></p>
      <p>
        AI should not harm, and where ever possible, should promote, the
        equality of individuals in respect to their rights, dignity and freedom
        to flourish (The Future Society, 2018; Tieto, 2018). One way equality
        can be enabled is through greater diversity in AI teams and data sets
        and designs (Sage, 2017). More steps need to be taken to address sexist,
        misogynistic and gender-biased harms resulting from some AI (World Wide
        Web Foundation, 2018).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>2.6 Equity. </strong></p>
      <p>
        The aims of AI, generally, should be to empower and benefit individuals,
        provide equal opportunities while distributing the rewards from its use
        in a fair and equitable manner (EGE, 2018; IEEE, 2019; SIIA, 2017). AI
        should be developed so that it can be used within society in a fair and
        equal way (Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence, 2017).
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>2.7 Non-bias. </strong></p>
      <p>
        AI organisations should invest in ways to identify, address and mitigate
        unfair biases (ICDPPC, 2018). Developers should examine unfair biases at
        every stage of the development process and should eliminate those found
        (The Public Voice, 2018). There should be close attention paid to the
        training data used, potential human biases and bias derived from the
        results of algorithmic processes (Cerna Collectif, 2018). Developers and
        organisational users of AI should conduct analysis to identify unfair
        bias, and there should be explicit attempts to avoid individual and
        societal bias, continual mechanisms in place and dialogue with
        stakeholders to raise awareness and reverse any biases detected (IBM,
        2018). If there is any indication of unfair bias, the AI organisations
        should demonstrate the elimination of such bias before a competent
        authority (Council of Europe, 2017).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>2.8 Non-discrimination. </strong></p>
      <p>
        AI should be designed for universal usage and not discriminate against
        people, or groups of people, based on gender, race, culture, religion,
        age or ethnicity (Cerna Collectif, 2018). There should be mechanisms in
        place to effectively prevent, remedy and reverse discriminatory outcomes
        resulting from AI use (Amnesty International/Access Now, 2018). AI use
        should not lead to discrimination against individuals or groups of
        individuals in accordance with the Equality Act 2010, and organisations
        should create &ldquo;discrimination impact assessments&rdquo; to
        identify issues before their AI are used (AI for Humanity, 2018).
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>2.9 Diversity. </strong></p>
      <p>
        To promote diversity, AI organisations should instil an inclusionary
        working environment (Cerna Collectif, 2018), hire teams from a range of
        backgrounds (IBM, 2018) and disciplines (SAP, 2018), conduct regular
        diversity sessions and incorporate the viewpoints from a wide range of
        stakeholders (Amnesty International/Access Now, 2018). Organisations
        implementing and using AI should encourage a diversity of opinions
        throughout every stage of its use (Smart Dubai, 2019).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>2.10 Plurality. </strong></p>
      <p>AI developers should consider the range of social and cultural</p>
      <p>
        viewpoints within society and should attempt to prevent societal
        homogenization of behaviour and practices (University of Montreal,
        2017). Organisations should not only be focused on &ldquo;pipeline
        model&rdquo; changes in their organisation but should ensure that the
        plurality of individuals within their organisation have a voice and they
        create a culture of inclusion, which should be reflected in the AI
        technology (AI Now Institute, 2018). Create a multi-stakeholder dialogue
        and incorporate the viewpoints of women, underrepresented groups and
        marginalised individuals at every stage of AI applications (Leaders of
        the G7, 2018).
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>2.11 Accessibility. </strong></p>
      <p>
        Organisations should protect the rights of data subjects, such as the
        right of information access about them (Datatilsynet, 2018). Individuals
        have a right to access data that is being stored and used about them,
        and subsequently, to request that this is rectified or deleted
        (Datatilsynet, 2018). When decisions are made about individuals,
        explanations should be available that are easily accessed, free of
        charge and user-friendly (Smart Dubai, 2019).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>2.12 Reversibility. </strong></p>
      <p>
        It is important to clearly articulate if the outcomes of AI decisions
        are reversible, e.g. if individuals are refused a loan because of an AI
        algorithm, can such a decision be reversed if the customer can
        demonstrate their credit-worthiness (Personal Data Protection Commission
        Singapore, 2019, p. 16)? Organisations using AI need to ensure that the
        autonomy of AI is restricted and the outcomes are reversible when there
        is a harm caused (Floridi et al., 2018). AI should be programmed with a
        condition of reversibility, which ensures controllability and safety of
        the system: The ability to undo the last action or a sequence of actions
        allows users to undo undesired actions and get back to the
        &lsquo;good&rsquo; stage of their work&rdquo; (Clark, 2019).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>2.13 Remedy. </strong></p>
      <p>
        When AI holds the possibility of creating harm, there needs to be
        preemptive steps in place to trace these issues and deal with them in a
        prompt and responsible manner. Organisations should abide by the
        &ldquo;termination obligation&rdquo;, which states that when a system is
        no longer under human control, then it must be terminated (Telef?onica,
        2018). There needs to be specific &ldquo;red lines&rdquo; drawn, that
        when breached, appropriate steps are taken to override the system,
        terminate it temporarily or indefinitely and remedy any potential issues
        that may have occurred (PwC, 2019).
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>2.14 Redress. </strong></p>
      <p>
        In situations where harmful and/or unjust events occur as a result of
        using AI, those affected should have appropriate and visible measures of
        redress in a timely manner (FATML, 2016). When decisions made by
        algorithms create harmful or questionable results, individuals should
        have the possibility to lodge a complaint and request a justification of
        the decision (Algo.Rules, 2019). This should be done in a manner that is
        understandable by those affected and should allow them the opportunity
        to challenge these decisions (B Debate, 2017). Accountability strategies
        should be created within companies, with appropriate measures for
        redress if these internal and external standards are not met (Dawson et
        al.,2019).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>2.15 Challenge. </strong></p>
      <p>
        AI companies should allow for &ldquo;conscientious objectors, employee
        organizing and ethical whistleblowers&rdquo; (AI Now Institute, 2018).
        There should be clear policies to protect conscientious objectors,
        employees to voice their concerns and whistle- blowers to feel
        protected, when it is in the public interest and safety (AI Now
        Institute, 2018).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p>2.16 Access and distribution.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        AI organisations should ensure that their technologies are fair and
        accessible among a diversity of user groups within society (Smart Dubai,
        2019). Organisations should especially concentrate on &ldquo;populations
        that currently lack such access&rdquo; (AI Now Institute, 2016, p. 3).
        AI should be accessible to those that are often socially disadvantaged
        (such as those with vision problems, dyslexia or mobility issues) (Sage,
        2017). Wherever possible, organisations should use open data for their
        AI to ensure access and transparency (NSTC, 2016b).
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <h2 class="about__title">3. Non-maleficence</h2>
      <p>
        The principle of nonmaleficence gained attention, resulting from
        Beauchamp and Childress (1979) ground-breaking Principles of Biomedical
        Ethics and its subsequent editions. In its most basic form, it means to
        do no harm or avoid doing harm to others. In AI ethics, the avoidance of
        harm to human beings has been one of the greatest concerns, with some of
        the most high-profile examples coming from killer robots, autonomous
        cars and drone technology. It is no surprise that most of the ethics
        guidelines had a strong emphasis on ensuring no harm comes to citizens,
        through security and safety of the AI, and precautionary and remedial
        steps to be taken, if harm occurs.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>3.1 Non-maleficence. </strong></p>
      <p>
        AI should be designed with the intent of not doing foreseeable harm to
        human beings (Personal Data Protection Commission Singapore, 2018).
        Developers and organisations using AI should receive and incorporate the
        advice of legal authorities and research ethics boards to ensure that
        data is retrieved, analysed and used in a manner that does not harm
        individuals [IPC Ontario (Information and Privacy Commissioner of
        Ontario), 2017]. Organisations should regularly test their algorithms to
        determine that no harm results from them (ACM2017; American College of
        Radiology, 2019).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>3.2 Security. </strong></p>
      <p>
        AI should be robust, secure and safe throughout their life cycle and
        must function appropriately and not pose unreasonable safety risks (OECD
        2019). Organisations must ensure effective cybersecurity so that their
        AI is protected against attacks (Allistene, 2014). Security must be
        built into the architecture of the AI (Public Voice 2018) and must be
        tested before implementation (Algo.Rules, 2019). When security
        researchers find vulnerabilities or design flaws, they should disclose
        these findings to be resolved (Internet Society, 2017).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>3.3 Safety. </strong></p>
      <p>
        Developers and organisational users should ensure that AI does not
        infringe on human rights by ensuring their technology&rsquo;s safety
        (EGE 2018). They must assess the public safety risks that arise from
        their AI and implement effective safety controls (Public Voice 2018).
        Organisations should enforce strict safety measures, ensuring their
        AI&rsquo;s manageability and control and that adequate procedures are in
        place for security breaches (Algo.Rules, 2019). AI should pass quality
        assurance processes and be tested in real-world scenarios before, during
        and after deployment (SAP 2018).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>3.4 Harm. </strong></p>
      <p>
        The objectives and expected impact of AI must be assessed and documented
        in the development stage (Algo.Rules, 2019). The effects of these
        systems must be reviewed on an ongoing basis (Algo.Rules, 2019).
        Organisations should encourage a form of &ldquo;algorithmic
        accountability&rdquo; and should exercise caution when developing AI
        that may have negative impacts (ICO, 2017). AI technology that replaces
        human activity should produce at least a diminution of harm before it is
        allowed on the market (Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital
        Infrastructure, 2017). AI should not &ldquo;cause bodily injury or
        severe emotional distress to any person&rdquo; (IIIM, 2015).
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>3.5 Protection. </strong></p>
      <p>
        Developers should implement mechanisms and safeguards to protect user
        safety (OECD 2019), and AI must be safe and secure throughout their life
        cycle (IEEE, 2019). AI systems should prioritize the protection of human
        life (Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure, 2017).
        External auditors should be allowed to conduct examinations and report
        negative impacts of the AI without fear of harm or threat by the AI
        organisations. In addition, the protection of whistle-blowers within AI
        organisations should also be ensured to allow for effective and
        legitimate reporting of harms (High-Level Expert Group on AI,
        2019,p.20).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>3.6 Precaution. </strong></p>
      <p>
        Those who develop AI must have the necessary skills to understand how
        they function and their potential impacts (Algo.Rules, 2019), and
        security precautions must be well documented (Public Voice 2018). AI
        organisations may receive advice from trained legal professionals,
        ethicists working in the area and policy analysts. If no consensus can
        be agreed upon, development of the AI &ldquo;should not proceed in that
        form&rdquo; (High-Level Expert Group on AI, 2019, p. 20). AI systems
        need to allow for human interruption, or their shutdown, when there is
        potential harm (Internet Society, 2017).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>3.7 Prevention. </strong></p>
      <p>
        An AI system must be manageable throughout the lifetime and its control
        must be made possible (Algo.Rules, 2019). The reliability and robustness
        of AI and its reliability with respect to attacks, access and
        manipulation must be guaranteed (Public Voice 2018). Great effort should
        be put into ensuring reliability and safety (IEEE, 2019). AI systems
        should prevent accidents from occurring, whenever possible, and avoid
        critical situations from occurring in the first place (Federal Ministry
        of Transport and Digital Infrastructure, 2017).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>3.8 Integrity. </strong></p>
      <p>
        Attacks against AI should not compromise the bodily and mental integrity
        of people by ensuring the reliability and internal robustness of the
        systems (EGE 2018). AI should &ldquo;fail gracefully&rdquo; (e.g.
        shutdown safely or go into safe mode) (IEEE, 2019).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>3.9 Non-subversion. </strong></p>
      <p>
        AI systems should be used to respect and improve the lives of citizens,
        rather than &ldquo;subvert, the social and civic processes on which the
        health of society depends&rdquo; (Future of LifeInstitute, 2017).
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <h2 class="about__title">4. Responsibility</h2>
      <p>
        Moral responsibility is a very important issue within AI ethics, with a
        fear that companies will try to obfuscate blame and responsibility onto
        the autonomous or semi-autonomous system. There may also be incidences
        where because of this relative autonomy, AI creates a
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;responsibility gap&rdquo;, whereby it is unclear who is
        responsible. Issues of responsibility, accountability, liability and
        acting with integrity appeared in many of the ethics guidelines that we
        analysed.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>4.1 Responsibility. </strong></p>
      <p>
        Developers are primarily responsible for the design and functionality of
        the AI, and when there is an error or harm, then the onus of
        responsibility often lies with them. When the issue is caused by the use
        and implementation of the technology, the onus is with the
        organisational user of the AI. There needs to be clear and concise
        allocation of responsibilities within the organisation using AI, and the
        creation of potential scenarios and ways to deal with harms when they
        occur (EGE 2018; FATML, 2016).
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>4.2 Accountability. </strong></p>
      <p>
        AI organisations need to be aware of the issues involved with using poor
        data and be held accountable if there are harmful consequences as a
        result of this. Developers need to be aware that they are accountable
        for these systems&rsquo; impact on the world (IBM, 2018). They need to
        be open and accountable by means of auditing, monitoring and conducting
        impact assessments of AI (ICDPPC, 2018). A legal person must always be
        held accountable for harms caused by AI and this blame cannot be placed
        on the tools that cause the damage (Algo.Rules, 2019).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>4.3 Liability. </strong></p>
      <p>
        There is a need to distinguish between the designer and organisational
        users of those systems for legal reasons (Cerna Collectif, 2018). To
        attribute liability in situations of malfunction, error and harms, there
        needs to be clear attributions of responsibility. Definitive liability
        should be established for when autonomous systems cause undesired
        effects (EGE, 2018). This can be achieved through adequate
        record-keeping, systems for registration, and documentation (IEEE,
        2019).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>4.4 Acting with integrity. </strong></p>
      <p>
        AI organisations must ensure that their data meets quality and integrity
        standards at every stage of use (ITI, 2017). If those working with AI
        discover errors, security breaches or data leaks, then they must report
        these issues to the relevant authorities, stakeholders, and if relevant,
        the wider public (University of Montreal, 2017). Ethics training should
        be implemented to ensure responsible development and deployment of AI
        (AI for Humanity 2018). AI companies should respect and support the
        academic and professional integrity of their partners and researchers
        (Deepmind, 2017).
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <h2 class="about__title">5. Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Since the GDPR came into force in 2018, privacy has been a hot topic for
        anyone working in fields where personal data is being used.
        Particularly, there is a great concern in the development and use of AI,
        with many of the ethics guidelines strongly featuring privacy and data
        protection as key tenets in their recommendations. Because of the large
        abundance of data that is required for AI to work, it is important that
        individuals&rsquo; privacy is not jeopardised as a result.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>5.1 Privacy. </strong></p>
      <p>
        Some of the steps that AI organisations should take to ensure privacy
        are the security of databases, storage and AI systems through
        de-identification, anomaly- detection and effective cybersecurity (IPC
        of Ontario, 2017); ensuring informed consent is retrieved (EGE, 2018);
        users should have control and access to data stored about them (IEEE,
        2019); follow current data protection regulations (UK Government, 2018)
        and non- regulatory privacy-by-design frameworks (ICDPPC, 2018) and
        ensuring that the data retrieved is of a high standard. Organisations
        purchasing off-the-shelf AI can cultivate a privacy culture by demanding
        privacy-by-design AI (Datatilsynet, 2018).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>5.2 Personal or private information.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The development and use of AI should ensure a strong adherence to the
        privacy and data protection standards outlined in the General Data
        Protection Regulation (2018), in addition to non-regulatory frameworks,
        such as privacy-by- design and privacy impact assessment frameworks
        (IEEE, 2019; Intel, 2018). Developers and organisational users of AI
        must place the end user&rsquo;s privacy and personal data at the
        forefront of the design process, viewing privacy as a human right
        (Latonero, 2018). The end user&rsquo;s personal data, and data derived
        or created about them, should be processed in a fair, lawful and
        legitimate way (UNDG, 2017). Whenever possible, the collection and use
        of personal data should be kept to a minimum, unless completely
        necessary and relevant.
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <h2 class="about__title">6. Beneficence</h2>
      <p>
        The principle of beneficence also gained greater acknowledgement and
        adoption after Beauchamp and Childress (1979) Principles of Biomedical
        Ethics. Beneficence essentially means to do good, to carry out an
        activity with the intention of benefitting someone or society as a
        whole. Often, beneficence is overlooked in the AI ethics literature,
        often being seen as a given that AI will bring benefits. The ethics
        guidelines we analysed highlighted beneficence to promote the
        flourishing of individual well-being, ensuring people receive benefits
        fromAI use, or that it should promote peace and the social and common
        good.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>6.1 Benefits. </strong></p>
      <p>
        AI organisations should ensure that their AI is designed to benefit
        humans (IEEE, 2019). They should clearly map out those benefits and the
        parties benefiting from them (The Information Accountability Foundation,
        2015). AI systems must create greater benefits than their costs for
        people (Dawson et al.,2019, p. 6) and should benefitas many people as
        possible (Future of LifeInstitute, 2017; The Partnership on AI, 2016).
        AI organisations should &ldquo;advance scientific understanding of the
        world, and to enable the application of this knowledge for the benefit
        and betterment of humankind&rdquo; (IIIM, 2015).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>6.2 Beneficence. </strong></p>
      <p>
        AI organisations should find solutions to some of the world&rsquo;s
        greatest problems, such as curing diseases, ensuring food security and
        preventing environmental damage (Intel, 2017). AI organisations should
        use data retrieved for the benefit of their customers and society (OP,
        2019). Ultimately, AI should &ldquo;compliment the human experience in a
        positive way&rdquo; (Unity Blog, 2018).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>6.3 Well-being. </strong></p>
      <p>
        AI organisations should ensure individual well-being and flourishing
        (IEEE, 2019). They should ensure that their AI is fit-for-purpose and
        that it does not prohibit individual development and access to primary
        goods, it ensures human welfare, and allows for the empowerment of
        individuals around the world (EGE, 2018). AI should be used to
        compliment those working in the health care sector to provide better
        care and support the well-being of patients (RCP London, 2018).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>6.4 Peace. </strong></p>
      <p>
        AI organisations should aim to avoid an &ldquo;arms race in lethal
        autonomous weapons&rdquo; (Future of Life Institute, 2017; see also
        Smart Dubai, 2019). If AI threatens peace, organisations should
        collaborate with governments to reduce potential conflicts (OpenAI,
        2018).
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>6.5 Social good. </strong></p>
      <p>
        AI should bring an improvement in beneficial opportunities for society
        (The Information Accountability Foundation, 2015, p. 10). AI
        organisations should cultivate a healthy AI industry ecosystem, built on
        cooperation and healthy competition (Government of the Republic of
        Korea, 2017, p. 62). The use of AI should not come at a cost of causing
        a conflict with non-users of these technologies (Ministry of State for
        Science and Technology Policy, 2019, p. 22). 4.6.6 Common good. AI
        should be developed to support the common good (Future of Life
      </p>
      <p>
        Institute, 2017) and the service of people (AGID, 2018). AI
        organisations should weigh up the benefits and harms resulting fromAI
        and should take careful consideration to develop ways to mitigate and
        harms to ensure an overall common good for society (The Information
        Accountability Foundation, 2015, p. 8). Appropriate steps should be
        considered to ensure that AI is used for good and that humanity is
        protected from potentially harmful impacts resulting from it (OpenAI,
        2018).
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <h2 class="about__title">7. Freedom and autonomy</h2>
      <p>
        Democratic societies place value in freedom and autonomy, and it is
        important that AI use does not encumber or harm these for us. The ethics
        guidelines addressed ways to ensure autonomy-promoting and
        liberty-protecting AI. For example, the AI organisation should ensure
        that individuals consent to how their data is being used, AI should not
        harm individuals&rsquo; abilities to make choices, or manipulate their
        self-determination.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>7.1 Freedom. </strong></p>
      <p>
        Developers should acknowledge, identify and ameliorate circumstances
        where AI may create harm against human freedoms. Organisations should
        ensure that the end users&rsquo; freedoms are not infringed upon during
        the use of AI (High-Level Expert Group on AI, 2019). Developers should
        ensure that AI does not harm end users through tracking (freedom of
        movement), censorship (freedom of expression) or surveillance (freedom
        of association).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>7.2 Autonomy. </strong></p>
      <p>
        AI organisations should ensure that end users are informed, not deceived
        or manipulated by AI and should be allowed to exercise their autonomy
        (EGE, 2018). AI organisations need to ensure that the &ldquo;principle
        of user autonomy must be central to the system&rsquo;s
        functionality&rdquo; (High-Level Expert Group on AI, 2019, p. 16). Users
        should be informed actors and have control over their decisions when
        interacting with AI (Council of Europe, 2019).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>7.3 Consent. </strong></p>
      <p>
        The use of personal data must be clearly articulated and agreed upon
        before its use (UNDG, 2017). If personal data is repurposed, developers
        should ensure that it is compatible with the original fair processing
        requirements when consent is given (ICO, 2017), in those cases where
        consent is the legal basis of data processing. Personal data should not
        be processed in a way that the data subject considers inappropriate or
        objectionable (Council of Europe, 2017). The use of personal data should
        also be done within reasonable expectations and consent of the
        individuals but must also be used for legitimate purposes (Future
        Advocacy, 2019).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>7.4 Choice. </strong></p>
      <p>
        AI should protect users&rsquo; power to decide about decisions in their
        lives (Floridi et al., 2018). AI should not &ldquo;compromise human
        freedom and autonomy by illegitimately and surreptitiously reducing
        options for and knowledge of citizens&rdquo; (European Group on Ethics
        in Science and New Technologies, 2018,p.17).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>7.5 Self-determination. </strong></p>
      <p>
        There needs to be a balance between decision-making power that is freely
        given by the user to the autonomous systems and when this option is
        taken away or undermined by the system (Floridi et al.,2018). AI
        organisations should not manipulate individual&rsquo;s
        self-determination, particularly those who may be vulnerable to abuse
        (Rathenau Institute, 2017,p. 26).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>7.6 Liberty. </strong></p>
      <p>
        AI organisations need to ensure that their AI protects
        individuals&rsquo; liberties, as outlined in many human rights
        legislations, such as the EU&rsquo;s Charter of Fundamental Human Rights
        (2000) and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948). Liberty
        refers to rights such as freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and
        freedom of movement. During the development of AI, there should be
        strong adherence to the protection of liberties, outlined in these
        fundamental human rights documents.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p>
        4.AI should be used to empower and strengthen our human rights, rather
        than curtailing or infringing upon them (ICDPPC, 2018). If decisions are
        made about individuals that may harm their liberties, they should be
        empowered with the right to challenge such decisions (ICO, 2017).
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <h2 class="about__title">8. Trust</h2>
      <p>
        Trust is such a fundamental principle for interpersonal interactions and
        is a foundational precept for society to function. Similarly, trust is
        being acknowledged as a key requirement for the ethical deployment and
        use of AI. The HLEG (2019) even use it as their defining paradigm for
        their ethics guidelines, referring to it throughout the entire document.
        It appears to be a relatively new phenomenon however, with most of the
        guidelines that make reference to trust coming after 2017.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>8.1 Trustworthiness. </strong></p>
      <p>
        AI organisations should prove they are trustworthy and that their
        technologies are reliable (Digital Decisions, 2019; MI Garage, 2019).
        End users should be able to justly trust AI organisations to fulfil
        their promises and to ensure that their systems function as intended
        (Deutsche Telekom, 2018; Institute of Business Ethics, 2018; Microsoft,
        2018; Sony, 2018; NITI Aayog, 2018; and Microsoft, 2017). Building trust
        should be encouraged by ensuring accountability, transparency and safety
        of AI (Royal Society, Organisations can cultivate trust by demonstrating
        the security of their AI (Intel, 2017) and guard the data retrieved from
        these systems in a responsible way (Unity Blog, 2018).
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <h2 class="about__title">9. Sustainability</h2>
      <p>
        Sustainability is a key principle in global discussions at present, and
        its importance is only set to rapidly increase as a result of climate
        change predictions and ongoing environmental destruction. All fields and
        disciplines are affected and need to incorporate sustainability agendas,
        and AI is no exception. Despite this, it did not appear as an overly
        pressing concern in the majority of guidelines, demonstrating a greater
        need to identify how it can be incorporated more effectively.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>9.1 Sustainability. </strong></p>
      <p>
        AI organisations need to ensure that they are environmentally
        sustainable and incorporate environmental outcomes within their
        decision-making (Special Interest Group on Artificial Intelligence,
        2018). There must be an adherence to resource- efficient, sustainable
        energy-promoting and the protection of biodiversity, by the AI.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>9.2 Environment (nature). </strong></p>
      <p>
        Organisations should use AI that has been developed in an
        environmentally conscious manner (SIIA, 2018). In situations where there
        is ecological harm caused by AI beyond acceptable levels, steps should
        be taken to either immediately halt it (temporarily or permanently),
        identify ways to use it in a non-harmful way or consult the designers
        for potential solutions and responses. AI should not be used to harm
        biodiversity (UNI Global 2017).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>9.3 Energy. </strong></p>
      <p>
        The use of AI should be respectful of energy efficiency, mitigate
        greenhouse gas emissions and protect biodiversity (University of
        Montreal, 2017). Those responsible for AI should ensure that its
        ecological footprint is minimal and all efforts are taken to reduce
        emission levels (Green Digital Working Group, 2016,p. 7).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>9.4 Resources (energy). </strong></p>
      <p>
        AI should be created in a way that ensures effective energy and resource
        consumption, promotes resource efficiency, the use of renewable
        materials, and reduction of use of scarce materials and minimal waste
        (European Parliament, 2017). Resource use and environmental impact
        should be held in importance in the life cycle impact assessment of AI
        (COMEST/UNESCO, 2017, p. 55).
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <h2 class="about__title">10. Dignity</h2>
      <p>
        Human dignity is the recognition that individuals have inherent worth
        and that their rights should be respected. It is important that AI does
        not infringe or harm the dignity of end users or other members within
        society. Respecting individuals&rsquo; dignity is a vital principle that
        should be taken into account within AI ethics guidelines.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>10.1 Dignity. </strong></p>
      <p>
        Human beings have intrinsic value and developers/organisational users
        should ensure that this is respected in the design and use of AI (The
        Conference toward AI Network Society, 2017). AI should be developed and
        used in a way that &ldquo;respects, serves and protects humans&rdquo;
        physical and mental integrity, personal and cultural sense of identity,
        and satisfaction of their essential needs&rdquo; (High-Level Expert
        Group on AI, 2019, p. 10). AI needs to be developed and used in a way
        that makes it clear to the user that they are interacting with AI and
        not another human being (EGE, 2018). Efforts need to be made to ensure
        that AI is not confused with human beings, as dignity is a value
        inherent to human beings (COMEST/UNESCO, 2017, p. 50). Organisations
        should ensure that their AI does not violate the end-user&rsquo;s
        dignity and should closely follow the principle of dignity outlined in
        the first chapter of the EU Charter (Latonero, 2018).
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <h2 class="about__title">11. Solidarity</h2>
      <p>
        With the widespread use of AI to disseminate fake news, its potential to
        surveil and invade individuals&rsquo; privacy, there is a growing
        concern that AI may be used to undermine and jeopardise societal
        relationships and solidarity. It is important to consider if the AI
        supports rich and meaningful social interaction, both professionally and
        in private life, and not support segregation and division, within the
        design and development process. AI should promote social security and
        cohesion and should not jeopardise societal bonds and
        relationships.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>11.1 Solidarity. </strong></p>
      <p>
        AI should be developed to promote, or avoid harm to, societal bonds and
        relationships between people and generations (University of Montreal,
        2017). AI should facilitate and promote human development, rather than
        being designed to obstruct or endanger it (ICDPPC, 2018). There should
        be consideration towards preserving and promoting solidarity and should
        not undermine existing social structures (Floridi et al., 2018). AI
        should not create &ldquo;social dislocation&rdquo;, whereby it adversely
        harm cultural and social identity, and those organisations that cause it
        should be held responsible (Accenture, 2019).
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>11.2 Social security. </strong></p>
      <p>
        Democratic values should not be jeopardised as a result of AI use and
        citizens should receive accurate and impartial information without
        interference or manipulation for political purposes (EGE, 2018). AI
        should not be developed or used to undermine electoral and political
        decision-making (High-Level Expert Group on AI, 2019). This can be done
        by ensuring that democratic values are promoted in AI development and
        implementation (EGE, 2018).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p><strong>11.3 Cohesion. </strong></p>
      <p>
        AI organisations should promote fair distribution of benefits from AI to
        ensure social cohesion is not harmed (Koski and Husso, 2018, p. 51). The
        use of AI should contribute to global justice, in the aim to promote
        social cohesion and solidarity (European Group on Ethics in Science and
        New Technologies, 2018,p.17). AI teams should not develop or use these
        technologies in a way that knowingly undermines &ldquo;functioning
        democratic systems of government&rdquo; (Unity Blog, 2018). AI
        organisations should actively develop strategies with academia, civil
        society and industry partners, to promote social cohesion and
        knowledge-exchange collaborations (Privacy International/Article 19,
        2018, p. 29).
